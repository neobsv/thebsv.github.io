      <description>Learning Rust with Excerpts and Examples from the Rust Book The GitHub repository for this is here: Learning Rust
Please click on the star button on the repo on GitHub to support this effort.
Here is a sentence from the book: &amp;ldquo;Nothing in Rust prevents a trait from having a method with the same name as another traitâ€™s method, nor does Rust prevent you from implementing both traits on one type.</description>

      <title>Ayu Theme for Vscode</title>

      <description>Ayu Theme Color Pop Vscode Here is my new code editor look: Installing the plain old Ayu Theme was pretty bland by default, and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to see some of the text and sidebar icons after enabling the theme.
I tinkered around a bit and found that I could change these colors by going under Settings -&amp;gt; Workspace -&amp;gt; Appearance and editing the settings.json file directly.
Don&amp;rsquo;t be scared of messing around with this file, yes it screws up your editor but keep a backup and just hack away.</description>

      <description>Life in Canada Pretty anxiety inducing, sometimes lonely, overall great
However, I got into trouble, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t really like it there. I knew it was just a temp thing till I get my citizenship and then I would be back in the US. However, I didn&amp;rsquo;t really want to go through with it so I decided to move to India.

      <description>Life in the US Most importantly, I learned how to support myself, and everything I needed to know to hone my craft and make a living. Literally nowhere else in the world would I have been able to learn this so well ( to the extent/degree/quality ) of I was taught both in university and during my employment there.
The only issue is the immigration system, I didn&amp;rsquo;t really like it.</description>
