      <description>Life in Canada Pretty anxiety inducing, sometimes lonely, overall great
However, I got into trouble, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t really like it there. I knew it was just a temp thing till I get my citizenship and then I would be back in the US. However, I didn&amp;rsquo;t really want to go through with it so I decided to move to India.

      <description>Life in the US Most importantly, I learned how to support myself, and everything I needed to know to hone my craft and make a living. Literally nowhere else in the world would I have been able to learn this so well ( to the extent/degree/quality ) of I was taught both in university and during my employment there.
The only issue is the immigration system, I didn&amp;rsquo;t really like it.</description>
